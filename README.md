# Art Portfolio


Hello and welcome to Art Portfolio. On this website, you will find a collection of photos presented in a calm full, and stress-relieving way. 
Art Portfolio is divided into an urban collection and a nature section giving you some photos from Sweden, mostly Stockholm. There is also an info link that leads you to some information about the creator. 

So have a preferred drink and take a moment!

## Features 

Let us start at the basic foundation. The body of the website is laid with a pink background and the grey cards are over a yellow background. The pink represents calmness and is there to lower testosterone since none of the pitchers bears the symbolism of aggression. The yellow represents scrap paper and light, together with the pink it hopefully brings forward the child in you and the joy of art, even if it is on a lower hobby level.  


### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__


  - Featured on all four pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Urban photos, Nature photos, and Info page and is identical on each page to allow for easy navigation. A fourth page is a form that has a link at the bottom of the page.
  - This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

- __The Main Content__

  - The main content of the website is photos and text cards. The photos are free to use royalty-free and the text is from Wikipedia. 
  - To get the art feeling of art the cards are sometimes named in their Swedish name.

- __The Footer__ 

  - The footer section includes links to a form and LinkedIn.

- __Form__

  - The form is an example where you can win a photo by telling which one you liked best. The link opens up in a new tab. This feature does not work and is made as an example. As told before every photo is royalty-free and taken by the creator so grab one however you like.

## Testing & Bugs

This website is made with basic HTML and CSS. The flexibility comes a lot from CSS "flex". This function makes position super easy and more dynamic than margin and padding in pixels. However, two pitchers ("Kaknästornet" in Urban and "Mamma" in Nature) get out of line in smaller laptop sizes. Not in a major way but should be corrected in a future update.

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
  - [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
  - [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#General)

Getting started with your Portfolio Projects can be daunting, planning your project can make it a lot easier to tackle, take small steps to reach the final outcome and enjoy the process!
