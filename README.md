# Art Portfolio


Hello and welcome to Art Portfolio. On this website, you will find a collection of photos presented in a calmful, and stress-relieving way. 
Art Portfolio is divided into an urban collection and a nature section giving you some photos from Sweden, mostly Stockholm. There is also an info link that leads you to some information about the creator. 

So have a preferred drink and take a moment!

## Features 

Let us start at the basic foundation. The body of the website is laid with a pink background and the grey cards are over a yellow background. The pink represents calmness and is there to lower testosterone since none of the pitchers bears the symbolism of aggression. The yellow represents scrap paper and light, together with the pink it hopefully brings forward the child in you and the joy of art, even if it is on a lower hobby level.  


### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__


  - Featured on all four pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Urban photos, Nature photos, and Info page and is identical on each page to allow for easy navigation. A fourth page is a form that has a link at the bottom of the page.
  - This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

- __The Main Content__

  - The main content of the website is photos and text cards. The photos are free to use royalty-free and the text is from Wikipedia. 
  - To get the art feeling of the artcards they are sometimes named in their Swedish name.

- __Form__

  - The form is an example where you can win a photo by telling which one you like best. The link opens up in a new tab. This feature does not work and is made as an example. As told before every photo is royalty-free and taken by the creator so grab one however you like.

## Testing & Bugs

This website is made with basic HTML and CSS. The flexibility comes mainly from CSS "flex". This function makes position super easy and more dynamic than margin and padding in pixels. However, two photos ("Kaknästornet" in Urban and "Mamma" in Nature) get out of line in smaller laptop sizes. Not in a major way but should be corrected in a future update. 

Testing features and links and works well. No other problems with the browser or other devices are recognized. 
Pitchers can take a long time to load but it's not a problem in a small project like this.
